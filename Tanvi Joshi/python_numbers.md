###### Comments : 
start with a `#` and take up the whole line
###### Input:
use `>>>` before the code line
###### Output:
just type the code as it is
##### Numbers:
- `int`, `float`, `Decimal`, `Fraction` some numeric types, complex numbers can be written with `j` or `J` suffix (1+2j)
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`(returns answer in float) are the normal operators
- `//` does floor division(returns only quotient)
- `%` returns remainder of the division
- `**` used for powers ( `x ** y` means x^(y) ), has higher precedence than `-`, so `-3**2` is -9, `(-3)**2` is 9
- `=` used to assign a value to a variable
- variables should be assigned a value before use
- last printed expression is assigned to the variable `_`
