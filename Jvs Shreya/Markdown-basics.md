## Markdown basics

These are short notes for future preference.

Alt Heading
---
*Italics 1* _Italics 2_

***

**Bold 1** __Bold 2__

---

**_Combined Emphasis_**

___

~~Strikethrough~~
1. This is a numbered list
2. next item
   * This is an unordered sub-list (* is used).
     + plus can be used 
   - minus as well
  
   Three spaces are left. Paragraph (which is part of list here) starts here. Even though you write a long sentence in the code, it will indent itself automatically. To have a line break, add two spaces at the end.  
Now this sentence is in the next line but still in the paragraph.

This line breaks from the paragraph.

***
For `code` - like words, use back-ticks.

For code use 3 back-ticks
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>

using namespace std;

int main(){
 int x; cin>>x;
 cout<<"The square is:"<<x*x;
}
```

|and then hyphens|centered|right
|bla|bla|bla

>Blockquotes are nice.

The End.
